CGD API Service Tests

This package contains tests for the CGD backend API services including:
- Curation services (locus, reference, GO, phenotype, etc.)
- Query services (search, blast, patmatch, etc.)
- Data export services (batch download, sequence, etc.)

All tests in this directory test the FastAPI service layer that
provides the REST API for the CGD web application.
